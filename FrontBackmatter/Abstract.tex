\chapterExtra{Abstract}
While you read this sentence, around a million WhatsApp messages are being sent. We share the details of our personal lives in them, from our highest hopes to our deepest fears. This is only possible because we assume them to remain private.

To protect user privacy, we implement an Android app called \gls{HiPS}. It creates a layer of protection currently missing from popular instant messengers: Steganography. We run \glspl{LLM} locally on smartphones to encode secret messages into inconspicuous cover texts. Our work is based on the Stegasuras project. By porting it to llama.cpp, we are able to swap \glspl{LLM} to scale with available hardware. We create chat conversations between cover texts, fine-tune their quality via a system prompt and plain text messages, and enrich them with emojis.

Lastly, we conducted a survey amongst students to compare our cover texts to real chat conversations. This delivered valuable insights in how to fine-tune cover text quality for this highly relevant demographic of users.
