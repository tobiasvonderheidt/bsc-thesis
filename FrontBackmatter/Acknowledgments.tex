I would like to thank my friends and family for supporting me throughout all the years of my studies. Special thanks for giving helpful advice and proofreading my thesis also goes to my supervisor, Nils Rollshausen.

\bigskip

Last but not least, I would like to thank myself. I thank myself for believing in me, for doing all this hard work, for having no days off, for never quitting, for always being a giver and trying to give more than I receive, for trying to do more right than wrong - for just being me at all times.
